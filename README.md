## üçè Run on iOS Simulator (macOS Only)

You can try BeyondLife on your local machine using a prebuilt `.app` file‚Äîno compilation needed.  
This method is ideal for users who want to explore the interface without setting up a full development environment.


### üß∞ Requirements

To use this method, you must have:

- A Mac running macOS
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed
- iOS Simulator configured (included with Xcode)
- A stable internet connection

## üì¶ Download Prebuilt App

The prebuilt iOS Simulator version of BeyondLife is included in this repository.
You can find the archive file at:

```
iOS-Simulator/application.tar
```

### üìÇ Steps to Install:

1. **Extract the tar file**:  
   In Terminal or Finder, decompress the archive to retrieve the `.app` bundle:
   ```bash
   tar -xvf iOS-Simulator/application.tar
   ```

2. **Launch your iOS Simulator**:  
   You can open it via Xcode or run:
   ```bash
   open -a Simulator
   ```

3. **Drag and drop the `.app` into the simulator**:  
   Simply drag the extracted `.app` file onto the open simulator window ‚Äî it will install and launch automatically.

> ‚úÖ No compilation required ‚Äî ideal for quick testing or previewing the UI flow.
